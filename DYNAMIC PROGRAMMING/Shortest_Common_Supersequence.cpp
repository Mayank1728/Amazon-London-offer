/*
Given two strings X and Y of lengths m and n respectively, find the length of the smallest string which has both, X and Y as its sub-sequences.
Note: X and Y can have both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Example 1

Input:
X = abcd, Y = xycd
Output: 6
Explanation: Shortest Common Supersequence
would be abxycd which is of length 6 and
has both the strings as its subsequences.

Example 2

Input:
X = efgh, Y = jghi
Output: 6
Explanation: Shortest Common Supersequence
would be ejfghi which is of length 6 and
has both the strings as its subsequences.

Your Task:
Complete shortestCommonSupersequence() function that takes X, Y, m, and n as arguments and returns the length of the required string.

Expected Time Complexity: O(Length(X) * Length(Y)).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Length(X) * Length(Y)).

Constraints:
1<= |X|, |Y| <= 100
*/


// X : 1st given string of size m
// Y : 2nd given string of size n
int shortestCommonSupersequence(char* X, char* Y, int m, int n) {
    //Find length of LCS and then subtract it from len(X)+len(Y)
    
    int dp[m+1][n+1];
    memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
    
    for(int i=1; i<=m; i++){
        for(int j=1; j<=n; j++){
            if(X[i-1]==Y[j-1]){
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1;
            }else{
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    int lenLCS = dp[m][n];
    
    return (m+n) - lenLCS;
}
